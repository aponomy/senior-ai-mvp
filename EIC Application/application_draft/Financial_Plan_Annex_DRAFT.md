- **Target**: 5,000-50,000 MAU
- **Investment**: €600k localization, 10-15 B2B2C pilots

**Phase 2 (Year 3-4): Germany + Netherlands + Denmark**
- **Markets**: Germany, Netherlands, Denmark
- **Rationale**: Large markets (18.4M + 3.5M + 1.2M elderly), EUDI wallet rollout, DiGA pathway potential
- **Target**: 80,000-350,000 MAU
- **Investment**: €750k localization (German, Dutch, Danish)

**Phase 3 (Year 5+): France + Belgium + Austria**
- **Markets**: France, Belgium, Austria
- **Rationale**: Mature operational model, proven playbook
- **Target**: 300,000-650,000 MAU (cumulative)

## Part III: Unit Economics & Scalability

### 3.1 Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV: €375-562**

**Calculation**:
- **ARPU**: €120-150/year (blending B2C and B2B2C)
- **Retention**: 70-80% annually (20-30% churn from mortality, institutionalization, health decline)
- **Customer lifespan**: 2.5-4.2 years
- **Gross margin**: 75-85% at scale (Year 3+)

**Formula**: LTV = ARPU × (1 / Churn Rate) × Gross Margin  
**Example (Year 3)**: €130 × (1 / 0.25) × 0.78 = **€405**

---

### 3.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**CAC: €75-150 blended**

**By Channel**:
- **B2C digital marketing**: €120-200 (Year 1) → €100-150 (Year 3) via referrals
- **B2C partnerships**: €50-100 (pensioner associations, pharmacies, libraries)
- **B2B2C**: €20-80 (bulk deals, lower per-user CAC)

**Improvement Drivers**:
- Referral program (€20-50 credit for successful referrals)
- Content marketing for long-tail organic acquisition
- Family advocacy (adult children as evangelists)
- B2B2C leverage (municipalities/care providers as distribution channels)

---

### 3.3 Key Performance Indicators

| Metric | Year 2 | Year 5 | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | 3:1 | 5-7:1 | ≥3:1 healthy, ≥4:1 excellent |
| **CAC Payback Period** | 12-18 months | 10 months | ≤12 months |
| **Gross Margin** | 68% | 85% | ≥75% (SaaS) |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 85-90% | 95-105% | ≥100% (best-in-class) |
| **Rule of 40** | 354% | 122% | ≥40% (growth + EBITDA%) |

| **100k MAU** | €2-3 | 75-80% |
| **500k MAU** | €1.5-2.5 | 80-85% |

**Cost Breakdown**:
- LLM APIs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude): €0.30-0.60/user/month
- Cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare, Supabase): €0.20-0.40/user/month
- Observability & monitoring: €0.10-0.20/user/month
- Voice services (STT/TTS): €0.05-0.15/user/month

**Optimization Levers**:
- **80/20 model mix**: 80% GPT-4o-mini (low cost), 20% Claude Sonnet (high quality)
- **Context compression**: Reduce token usage by 40-60%
- **Edge STT**: Whisper.cpp for local processing

| **Reduced informal care burden** | **€195M** | 125k users × 1 hour/week × €30/hour × 52 weeks |
| **Healthcare efficiency** | **€50M** | 25k users × €2k avoided medication errors |
| **Municipal digital inclusion savings** | **€375M** | 100k municipal users × €3.75k program cost avoided |
| **TOTAL ECONOMIC VALUE** | **€970M/year** | - |

**Return on Investment**:
- **User spending**: 500k users × €180/year = €90M/year

### 8.2 Downside Scenario (Conservative Case)

**Assumptions**:
- MAU growth 20% lower: 380k MAU Year 5 (vs. 475k base)
- ARPU 10% lower: €122 average (vs. €135 base)
- Gross margin 5pp lower: 80% (vs. 85% base)
- CAC 20% higher: €120 (vs. €100 Year 3)

**Outcomes**:
- **Year 5 Revenue**: €51M (vs. €64M base) = 20% lower
- **Year 5 EBITDA**: €22M (vs. €33M base) = 33% lower
- **Break-even**: Delayed 6-9 months (Year 3 Q3 vs. Year 2-3)
- **Series A valuation**: €30M pre (vs. €40M base) = 25% lower dilution
- **Founders post-Series A**: 51% combined (vs. 56% base) = still strong control

**Financial stress-tested**: Even in conservative case:
- ✅ Runway maintained >18 months
- ✅ Profitability achieved Year 3-4
- ✅ No "down round" risk
- ✅ Founders retain majority control
