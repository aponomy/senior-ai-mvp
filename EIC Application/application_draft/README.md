## Known Gaps and Assumptions

### Assumptions Made
1. **Team Size:** 2 founders currently; scaling to 9-11 FTEs by M12
2. **Founder Salaries:** €3,500-4,800/month during grant phase (Swedish standard)
3. **Budget Split:** 48% personnel, 13% external services, 6% pilots, etc.
4. **Pilot Pricing:** €300-600 per participant for paid pilot model
5. **Sales Cycles:** 4-8 months (Swedish municipal), 3-6 months (Norwegian), 2-4 months (care)
6. **TRL Timing:** TRL 5→6 by M6, 6→7 by M12, 7→8 by M18
7. **Indirect Costs:** 25% flat rate (EIC standard, but confirm)

### Information Gaps
1. **Current TRL Status:** Assumed TRL 5 based on descriptions; needs validation
2. **Existing IP:** Assumed prototype exists; specifics not detailed
3. **Competitive Landscape:** High-level only; detailed analysis may exist in other issues
4. **Financial Projections:** 5-year model exists in Issue #13 docs but not integrated here
5. **Previous Funding:** Not mentioned; may affect EIC evaluation
6. **Company Legal Status:** Not specified (AB? Not yet incorporated?)

## Integration with Other Issues

This assembly covers **Issue #12 (Implementation Plan & Team)**. It should be integrated with:

- **Issue #10:** Excellence section (innovation, TRL, competitive advantage, IP)
- **Issue #11:** Impact section (market opportunity, scalability, European value)
- **Issue #13:** Financial plan (cap table, equity strategy, 5-year projections)

## Document Quality Notes

**Strengths of Current Drafts:**
✅ Comprehensive structure covering all EIC requirements  
✅ Realistic timeline based on expert consultation  
✅ Detailed risk management with mitigation budgets  
✅ Clear TRL progression strategy  
✅ Well-defined pilot program with safety oversight  
✅ Regulatory compliance roadmap aligned with Swedish/Norwegian requirements  

**Areas for Improvement:**
⚠️ Some sections are high-level and need specific details  
⚠️ Budget numbers are estimates pending validation  
⚠️ Team composition is planned but not yet assembled  
⚠️ Pilot partners are targets but not yet committed (LOIs pending)  
⚠️ Task quantification could be more specific in places  

**Overall Assessment:**
These drafts provide a **solid foundation** for the EIC application. They demonstrate thorough planning, realistic timelines, and comprehensive understanding of requirements. However, they are **working drafts** that need validation, refinement, and integration with other application components before submission.
