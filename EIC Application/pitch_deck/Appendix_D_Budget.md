## Break-Even Analysis Details

### Fixed Costs (Year 2, Steady-State)

| Category | Annual Cost |
|----------|-------------|
| **Personnel** (10-11 FTEs × €110k) | €1,200,000 |
| **Infrastructure** (fixed baseline) | €150,000 |
| **Marketing** (fixed brand/content) | €200,000 |
| **G&A** (legal, accounting, office) | €250,000 |
| **Total Fixed Costs** | **€1,800,000** |

### Variable Economics (per user, Year 2)

| Item | Cost/User/Year |
|------|----------------|
| **Cloud & Infrastructure** | €18 |
| **LLM API Costs** | €12 |
| **Integration/API** | €9 |
| **Support** (blended) | €9 |
| **Total Variable COGS** | **€48** |

**Contribution Margin**: €133 (ARPU) - €48 (COGS) = **€85/user/year**

**Break-Even MAU**: €1,800,000 / €85 = **21,176 paying users**

**With 85% signup→paying conversion**: 21,176 / 0.85 = **~25,000 total users** to break even

**Timeline**: Achieved in Year 2 at 40-66k MAU
