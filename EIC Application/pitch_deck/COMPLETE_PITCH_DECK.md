# Slide 2: The Problem

**Speaker Note:** "70-85M Europeans are locked out of both essential services AND the AI revolution—banking, healthcare, but also creativity, learning, exploration."

---

# **70-85M** Elderly Europeans  
# Left Behind by TWO Revolutions

---

## The Crisis

**Essential Services Going Digital:**
Banking → 25-30% branch closures  
Healthcare → e-prescriptions mandatory  
Government → 80-90% services digital-only  
**Result:** 40-60% abandon tasks mid-process

**AI Revolution Inaccessible:**
Thousands of AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly)  
Too complex to find, understand, compare  
**Result:** Elderly excluded from creativity, learning, exploration

---

## Current Solutions Fail

**Alexa/Google** → Lose context after 3-5 turns  
**ElliQ** → $250 + $60/mo, companionship only  
**AI Suites** (Adobe, Perplexity) → Not designed for elderly users

---

## EU Policy Urgency

**Digital Decade 2030:** 80% digital skills (gap: 40-50pp)  
**Accessibility Act:** June 2025 compliance deadline  
**40-50M elderly** require intervention NOW

# Slide 4: The Solution

**Speaker Note:** "Senior AI is an accessibility layer for the entire AI ecosystem—making thousands of AI services usable through one elderly-optimized interface."

---

# Senior AI
**The Accessible Gateway to AI Services + Digital Life**

---

## What We Do

### **AI Accessibility Layer**
One interface to thousands of AI services  
(Like Adobe Firefly or Perplexity—but designed for elderly users)

**Create:**  
Generate images, videos, presentations  
Write stories, letters, poems

**Explore:**  
Learn new topics, research questions  
Discover music, art, culture

**Connect:**  
Communicate with family, friends  
Share memories, collaborate

**Execute:**  
Banking, healthcare, government, shopping  
Travel, legal, insurance, home services

---

## How It Works

### **Conversation Atlas:** Never lose context (30+ turns)
### **Safe Branching:** Explore "what if" without fear
### **Memory:** Everything preserved, nothing forgotten

---

## Domains: 14+ Life Areas

🎨 **Create** (Images, Videos, Writing) | 📚 **Learn** (Research, Explore)  
🏥 Healthcare | 💳 Banking | 🚌 Transport | 🏛️ Government

# Slide 5: What Makes It Novel

**Speaker Note:** "We're an accessibility layer for the AI ecosystem—making ChatGPT, Midjourney, and thousands of services usable for elderly users through W3C-compliant cognitive design."

---

# The Innovation: AI Accessibility Layer
**(Backed by Research)**

---

## The Market Gap

**Thousands of AI services exist:**  
ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly, Runway, ElevenLabs...

**But elderly users can't access them:**  
Too hard to find, understand, compare, use

**AI Suites emerging (Adobe, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot):**  
Package multiple AI services—but NOT designed for elderly cognition

**Senior AI = First elderly-accessible AI gateway**

---

## Four Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. Branch-Preserving Conversation Atlas
Multi-resolution interface (Timeline | Key Points | Detail)  
**Research:** W3C Cognitive Accessibility, ISO 21801-1, HCI Studies  
**Enables:** 6-10× context retention, visual scaffolding

### 2. Non-Destructive Branching via DAG
Versioned memory, safe exploration, intelligent merge  
**Research:** ADHD interventions, older adult HCI error recovery  
**Enables:** 60-80% error reduction, "what-if" without fear

### 3. Population-Specific Safety
Elderly-tuned risk detection, audit trails, caregiver oversight  
**Research:** MCI/dementia assistive tech, voice assistant privacy  
**Enables:** Safe execution in banking, healthcare, government

### 4. EU-Sovereign Orchestration
GDPR-first, BankID/eIDAS 2.0, FHIR/EHDS, 14+ domains  
**Research:** Multi-domain orchestration gap, EN 301 549/WCAG 2.2 AAA  
**Enables:** Competitive moat (24-36 month replication time)

# Slide 7: Market Opportunity

**Speaker Note:** "We're targeting €12.7B TAM, starting with a €2.1B beachhead in Scandinavian healthcare and finance."

---

# Elderly Digital Assistance Market

---

## Market Sizing (5-year horizon, 2025-2030)

**TAM** (Total Addressable Market): **€12.7B**  
EU elderly digital assistance (70-85M users × €150-180 ARPU)

**SAM** (Serviceable Available Market): **€6.8B**  
Tier 1-2 metro + urban areas (tech-accessible infrastructure)

**SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable Market, Y5): **€380-410M**  
2.0-2.3M users in beachhead segments × €167-179 ARPU

---

## Beachhead Strategy (Years 1-2)

### **Scandinavia + DACH** (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria)
- BankID/eIDAS integration mature

# Slide 8: Competition & Moat

**Speaker Note:** "Voice assistants fail at complex tasks. Chatbots lose context. We're the only EU-sovereign, elderly-specific solution."

---

# Competitive Positioning

---

## 2×2 Matrix: Task Complexity vs. Elderly-Specific Design

|                     | **Generic Design** | **Elderly-Specific** |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Simple Tasks**    | Alexa, Google Assistant | ElliQ, Senior tablets |
| **Complex Tasks**   | ChatGPT, Claude    | **Senior AI** ←       |

**Result:** We're the only player in the high-complexity, elderly-optimized quadrant.

---

## Why Competitors Can't Follow Quickly

### 1. **Conversation Atlas + DAG Branching**
18-24 months R&D investment  
Patent-pending architecture

### 2. **EU-Sovereign Orchestration**
14+ domain integrations (BankID, FHIR, eIDAS 2.0)  
Regulatory compliance (AI Act, GDPR-first)

### 3. **Population Safety Tuning**
Elderly-specific risk models & validation datasets  
60-80% error reduction (vs. generic LLMs)

### 4. **Network Effects**
Multi-domain memory (banking → healthcare → transport)  
Value increases with each integrated service

# Slide 9: Business Model & Unit Economics

**Speaker Note:** "Profitable unit economics at scale. 3:1 LTV:CAC by Year 3, expanding to 5:1 by Year 5."

---

# Revenue Streams

---

## Three-Tier Model

### **B2C Direct** (40% of revenue)
€9.99/month base + €3-5 domain packs  
→ €120-180 ARPU annually

### **B2B2C White-Label** (45% of revenue)
Banks, insurers, municipalities subsidize  
→ €30-50 ARPU (volume pricing)

### **B2B Enterprise** (15% of revenue)
Call center automation, care homes  
→ €600-1,200/seat/year

---

## Unit Economics (Year 3 Steady State)

### **LTV** (Lifetime Value): **€480-540**
3-4 years average retention × €120-180 ARPU  
85-90% gross margin

### **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost): **€140-160**
Performance marketing + B2B2C partnerships

### **LTV:CAC Ratio**: **3.2:1** (Year 3) → **5.1:1** (Year 5)
Improved by network effects + organic referrals

### **Payback Period**: **11-13 months**
