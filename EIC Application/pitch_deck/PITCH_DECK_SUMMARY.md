## 🔑 Key Messages (Memorize These)

### One-Sentence Value Proposition
"Senior AI doubles task completion and halves cognitive load for 125M elderly Europeans, across 14+ life domains, with GDPR-first data handling."

### Why Now
"European Accessibility Act (June 2025), Digital Decade targets, eIDAS 2.0 rollout, and AI maturity enable scale."

### Core Differentiation
"No competitor combines EU data sovereignty + elderly-specific cognitive accessibility + multi-domain execution + accessible pricing (€10-20/month)."

### Evidence Hook
"In TRL5 tests, we achieved ≥2× task completion vs. Alexa/Google and reduced errors by up to 80%."

### Market Opportunity
"€6-14B annually serving 109M elderly across EU27/UK/Norway; our beachhead is 70-85M with low digital skills."

### EU Alignment
"We are designed for the AI Act and Accessibility Act, integrated with eIDAS and EHDS."

### Ask
"€6.5-7M to scale an EU-sovereign solution that makes digital life accessible for millions."

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Placeholder Content
Some slides contain **[Placeholder]** fields that need to be filled:
- **Slide 13 (Team)**: Founder names, bios, photos, LinkedIn
- **Appendix E (Partners)**: Actual organization names (or keep anonymized for now)
- **All slides**: "Company Name" → replace with actual company name

### Data Validation
All numbers are based on Nov 2025 application drafts. **Validate before final:**
- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- TRL 5 outcomes (n=30 study - confirm these are real/planned)
- Pilot pipeline (confirm LOI status)
- Financial projections (ensure consistency across all slides)

### Confidentiality
- Mark deck as **"Confidential - EIC Application"**
- Consider which version to share externally vs. internally
- Partner names may need anonymization for public versions

## 🎬 Delivery Tips (From Expert Consultation)

### Script Preparation
- **1-2 sentences per slide maximum**
- **10 minutes total** (14 slides = ~40 seconds/slide average, some longer/shorter)
- **Memorize key transitions** so flow is smooth
- **End with vision** - emotional, aspirational close

### Body Language
- **Confidence**: Stand, make eye contact, project energy
- **Passion**: Let belief in mission show through
- **Clarity**: Speak slowly enough for non-native English speakers
- **Accessibility**: Consider live captions if presenting remotely

### Q&A Preparation
- **Appendix slides ready** - toggle to them quickly
- **Anticipate questions**:
  - Technical: How does Conversation Atlas actually work?
  - Market: How do you compete with Big Tech?
  - Financial: When do you break even? What if growth is slower?
  - Risk: What if AI Act delays? What if users don't adopt?
  - Team: Why are you the right team? Who else do you need?
- **Honesty**: Don't BS - say "I don't know, but here's how we'd find out"
