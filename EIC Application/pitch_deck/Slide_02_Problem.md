# Slide 2: The Problem

**Speaker Note:** "70-85M Europeans are locked out of both essential services AND the AI revolution—banking, healthcare, but also creativity, learning, exploration."

# **70-85M** Elderly Europeans  
# Left Behind by TWO Revolutions

## The Crisis

**Essential Services Going Digital:**
Banking → 25-30% branch closures  
Healthcare → e-prescriptions mandatory  
Government → 80-90% services digital-only  
**Result:** 40-60% abandon tasks mid-process

**AI Revolution Inaccessible:**
Thousands of AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly)  
Too complex to find, understand, compare  
**Result:** Elderly excluded from creativity, learning, exploration

---

## Current Solutions Fail

**Alexa/Google** → Lose context after 3-5 turns  
**ElliQ** → $250 + $60/mo, companionship only  
**AI Suites** (Adobe, Perplexity) → Not designed for elderly users

## EU Policy Urgency

**Digital Decade 2030:** 80% digital skills (gap: 40-50pp)  
**Accessibility Act:** June 2025 compliance deadline  
**40-50M elderly** require intervention NOW
