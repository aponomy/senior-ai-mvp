# Slide 5: What Makes It Novel

**Speaker Note:** "We're an accessibility layer for the AI ecosystem—making ChatGPT, Midjourney, and thousands of services usable for elderly users through W3C-compliant cognitive design."

# The Innovation: AI Accessibility Layer
**(Backed by Research)**

## The Market Gap

**Thousands of AI services exist:**  
ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly, Runway, ElevenLabs...

**But elderly users can't access them:**  
Too hard to find, understand, compare, use

**AI Suites emerging (Adobe, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot):**  
Package multiple AI services—but NOT designed for elderly cognition

**Senior AI = First elderly-accessible AI gateway**

## Four Technical Breakthroughs

### 1. Branch-Preserving Conversation Atlas
Multi-resolution interface (Timeline | Key Points | Detail)  
**Research:** W3C Cognitive Accessibility, ISO 21801-1, HCI Studies  
**Enables:** 6-10× context retention, visual scaffolding

### 2. Non-Destructive Branching via DAG
Versioned memory, safe exploration, intelligent merge  
**Research:** ADHD interventions, older adult HCI error recovery  
**Enables:** 60-80% error reduction, "what-if" without fear

### 3. Population-Specific Safety
Elderly-tuned risk detection, audit trails, caregiver oversight  
**Research:** MCI/dementia assistive tech, voice assistant privacy  
**Enables:** Safe execution in banking, healthcare, government

### 4. EU-Sovereign Orchestration
GDPR-first, BankID/eIDAS 2.0, FHIR/EHDS, 14+ domains  
**Research:** Multi-domain orchestration gap, EN 301 549/WCAG 2.2 AAA  
**Enables:** Competitive moat (24-36 month replication time)
