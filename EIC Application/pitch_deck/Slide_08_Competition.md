## 2×2 Matrix: Task Complexity vs. Elderly-Specific Design

|                     | **Generic Design** | **Elderly-Specific** |
|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Simple Tasks**    | Alexa, Google Assistant | ElliQ, Senior tablets |
| **Complex Tasks**   | ChatGPT, Claude    | **Senior AI** ←       |

**Result:** We're the only player in the high-complexity, elderly-optimized quadrant.

## Why Competitors Can't Follow Quickly

### 1. **Conversation Atlas + DAG Branching**
18-24 months R&D investment  
Patent-pending architecture

### 2. **EU-Sovereign Orchestration**
14+ domain integrations (BankID, FHIR, eIDAS 2.0)  
Regulatory compliance (AI Act, GDPR-first)

### 3. **Population Safety Tuning**
Elderly-specific risk models & validation datasets  
60-80% error reduction (vs. generic LLMs)

### 4. **Network Effects**
Multi-domain memory (banking → healthcare → transport)  
Value increases with each integrated service
