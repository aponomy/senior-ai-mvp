## Senior AI Pitch Deck: The Accessible Gateway to AI for 125M Elderly Europeans

---

### Slide 1: Title & Breakthrough Vision

# Senior AI
**The Accessible Gateway to AI for 125M Elderly Europeans**

### Create • Learn • Explore • Execute

| EU-Sovereign | Cognitive-Accessible | 14+ Domains |

# Why Now: The Mandate for Inclusion
**🤖 AI Revolution:** Thousands of tools are inaccessible to elderly users.
**🇪🇺 Accessibility Act:** June 2025 compliance deadline mandates accessible services.
**📊 Digital Decade 2030:** Requires 80% digital skills, facing a massive 40-50 percentage point gap in the elderly population.

# Proven Results (TRL 5 Validation)
### **2× Task Completion**
### **50% Less Cognitive Load**
### **80% Fewer Errors**
### **30+ Turn Context** (vs. 3-5 turns for competitors)

---

### Slide 2: The Problem – Digital Exclusion at Scale

# 70-85M Elderly Europeans
**Left Behind by TWO Revolutions**

### The Crisis: Essential Services Going Digital
*   **Banking:** 25-30% branch closures.
*   **Healthcare:** E-prescriptions mandatory.
*   **Government:** 80-90% services digital-only.
*   **Result:** **40-60%** of elderly users abandon multi-step digital tasks mid-process.

### The AI Revolution is Inaccessible
*   Thousands of powerful AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly) are **too complex** to find, understand, compare, or use.
*   **Result:** Elderly users are excluded from creativity, learning, and exploration. An additional **50 million** Europeans with ADHD, MCI, or early dementia face identical barriers.

# Current Solutions Fail the Cognitive Test
*   **Alexa/Google Assistant:** Interactions are linear and **lose context after 3-5 turns**.
*   **ElliQ (Companion Robots):** Focus on companionship, limited domain scope, and high cost ($250 + $60/month).
*   **AI Suites (Adobe, Perplexity):** Not designed for elderly cognition or digital literacy.

### Slide 3: Our Users & Market Opportunity

# Three User Personas
Our users want to stay **creative, curious, and independent**—not just 'not be left behind'.

| Persona | Maria, 78 (Stockholm) | Lars, 83 (Bergen) | Ingrid, 72 (Copenhagen) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Wants** | Create family photo books, Learn history, Write memoirs | Research WWII ships, Generate images, Stay informed | Create digital art, Explore music, Collaborate with grandkids |
| **Needs** | Remember context, Explore safely, Simple tools | Multi-day memory, Maintain independence | Non-destructive branching, Task resumption |

# Total Addressable Market (TAM): **€6–14 Billion** Annually

| Segment | Target Group | Market Size |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | 70-85M low digital skills (facing exclusion) | €6.7–12.2B |
| **Secondary** | 23-31M cognitive challenges (MCI, ADHD) | €0.8–2.9B |
| **Tertiary** | 20-25M preventive users (aging-in) | €1.0–2.2B |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Create** | Generate images, videos, presentations, stories, poems | **Create, Media, Entertainment** |
| **📚 Learn** | Research new topics, explore culture safely | **Learn, Services** |
| **📲 Connect** | Communicate with family, share memories, collaborate | **Communication, Home** |
| **🏛 Execute** | Banking, healthcare, government, shopping, travel, legal | **Healthcare, Banking, Government, Transport, Shopping, Legal** |

# How It Works: Cognitive-Accessible by Design
*   **Conversation Atlas:** Multi-resolution interface for **30+ turns context retention**.
*   **Safe Branching:** Explore "what if" scenarios without losing the main thread (Non-Destructive DAG).
*   **AI Apps:** Visual workflow skeletons that transform complex tasks (e.g., bank transfers) into **clear, confidence-building, step-by-step journeys**.

---

### Slide 5: The Innovation: Four Technical Breakthroughs (The Moat)

# Senior AI = First Elderly-Accessible AI Gateway
We combine cognitive-accessible design (W3C-compliant) with secure, EU-sovereign orchestration to create a **24-36 month replication moat**.

### 1. Branch-Preserving Conversation Atlas
*   **Innovation:** Synchronized Multi-resolution interface (Timeline | Key Points | Detail).
*   **Enables:** **6–10× context retention**, anchoring users without cognitive overload.

### 2. Non-Destructive Conversation Branching via DAG
*   **Innovation:** Conversation state maintained as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with versioned memory.
*   **Enables:** Safe, user-controlled exploration of alternatives (e.g., pricing, dates) with **60-80% error reduction**.

### 3. Capability-Scoped Secure Execution
*   **Innovation:** Ephemeral, per-task capability tokens bound to conversational context. Population-specific safety policies enforced.
*   **Enables:** Safe execution in high-stakes regulated domains (banking, healthcare).

### 4. EU-Sovereign Orchestration Moat
*   **Innovation:** GDPR-first, EU data residency, BankID/eIDAS 2.0 integration.
*   **Enables:** Competitive moat against US/Asian Big Tech in regulated European markets.

### Slide 8: Competitive Positioning & Defensibility

# Competitive Positioning: The Uncontested Quadrant
Senior AI is the only player combining complex, multi-domain task execution with elderly-specific cognitive design.

| | **Generic Design** | **Elderly-Specific Design** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Tasks** | Alexa, Google Assistant | ElliQ, Senior Tablets |
| **Complex Tasks** | ChatGPT, Claude, AI Suites | **Senior AI** ← |

# Our Defensible Moat (24–36 Months)
1.  **Proprietary IP:** Conversation Atlas + DAG Branching architecture is patent-pending, requiring 18–24 months R&D to replicate.
2.  **Regulatory Moat:** **GDPR-first** architecture, EN 301 549 (EAA) compliance, and deep integration with **BankID/eIDAS 2.0**. US/Asian competitors cannot easily match this.
3.  **Population Safety Tuning:** Elderly-specific risk models reducing errors by 60–80%, essential for high-stakes domains (banking, health).
4.  **Network Effects:** Value increases with each integrated service (14+ domains) and user generation of structured, branch-aware memory.
