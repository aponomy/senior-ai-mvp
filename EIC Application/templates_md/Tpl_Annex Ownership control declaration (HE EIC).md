## Instructions

OWNERSHIP CONTROL DECLARATION

(To be filled in by the project participants as part of the application. All declarations must be assembled by the coordinator and uploaded in a single file in the Portal Submission System.

Beneficiaries and affiliated entities must always provide the form; associated partners and subcontractors must provide it only if required by the call conditions (for HE, associated partners always). Entities that are validated as public bodies by the Central Validation Service are exempted since they will automatically be considered as controlled by their country.

Supporting documents do not have to be provided at application stage, but will be requested later on. You will receive a task notification asking you to upload the documents to your PIC account in the Portal Participant Register. 

The supporting documents should reflect the situation at the moment you sign this declaration. Please be aware that additional evidence may also be requested later on, in case there are open questions about your ownership/control status.

 Please note that the information in this declaration may be reused in case you apply to other EU calls that have ownership/control restrictions.

 Please also note that you must inform the granting authority in case of changes in your shareholding during the project implementation, if these could impact the ownership/control requirements.)
