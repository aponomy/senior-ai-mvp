# Instructions for Major Conceptual Changes & Additions

**Purpose**: Process for systematically investigating and applying major conceptual changes across the entire EIC application when new strategic insights, positioning shifts, or fundamental additions emerge.

**When to Use**: 
- New market positioning discovered (e.g., "AI accessibility layer")
- Major competitive landscape shift (e.g., Adobe Firefly/Perplexity AI suites)
- Fundamental reframing of value proposition (e.g., defensive → empowering)
- Strategic pivot affecting multiple sections (technology, excellence, impact, business model)

**Worked Example**: Adding "AI accessibility layer" concept - thousands of AI services (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, Perplexity) made accessible through Create/Learn/Connect/Execute framework.

## Phase 1: Change Identification & Scope Assessment

### 1. **Capture the Change**
   - [ ] **What is the new concept/change?**
     - Write one-sentence description
     - Example: "Senior AI is an accessibility layer making thousands of existing AI services (creative, learning, exploration + execution) accessible to elderly users"
   
   - [ ] **What triggered this?**
     - User feedback
     - Market research discovery
     - Competitive analysis
     - Strategic realization
   
   - [ ] **Old vs. New positioning**
     - What was the previous framing?
     - Example: "Defensive ('don't get left behind') → Empowering ('join AI revolution')"

### 2. **Initial Impact Assessment**
   - [ ] **Quick scan**: Which materials mention the affected concept?
     ```bash
     grep -r "old concept" docs/ "EIC Application/"
