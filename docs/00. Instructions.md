# EIC Application Workflow Instructions

## Purpose
These instructions guide the iterative research and writing process for completing EIC Accelerator application sections. The workflow emphasizes deep research, reasoning, and synthesis before writing final content.

---

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Understanding & Context Gathering

1. **Read Foundation Documents**
   - [ ] Read `01. Description.md` first for project overview
   - [ ] Search `docs/` folder for adjacent information related to this task
   - [ ] Review any relevant converted documents in `EIC Application/EIC Application_md/`
   - [ ] Check existing GitHub issue description for specific requirements
   - [ ] List what you already know vs. what's missing

2. **Initial Gap Analysis**
   - [ ] Identify information gaps for this application section
   - [ ] Categorize gaps as:
     - **Strategic**: Questions about WHAT Senior AI is or should be → Ask user
     - **Research**: Questions requiring external information → Use expert
     - **Internal**: Questions answerable from existing docs → Search workspace
   - [ ] Create preliminary question list

3. **🛑 MANDATORY: Present Clarifying Questions to User**
   
   **BEFORE proceeding with research**, present 3-5 SHORT, SIMPLE questions.
   
   **Format** (KEEP IT MINIMAL):
   ```markdown
   ## Quick Questions Before I Start
   
   1. [Simple question in one sentence]?
   2. [Simple question in one sentence]?
   3. [Simple question in one sentence]?
   4. [Simple question in one sentence]?
   5. [Simple question in one sentence]?
   ```
   
   **Examples**:
   - "Should we emphasize the visual cards OR the full combination (cards + BankID + task execution)?"
   - "What's our current TRL? (3=concept, 4=prototype, 5=tested with users)"
   - "Primary target: tech-struggling seniors OR seniors needing help with complex tasks?"
   - "Which specific tasks can the agent actually do today?"
   - "Have you done any patent/prior art research yet?"
   
   **DO NOT**:
   - ❌ Explain why you're asking
   - ❌ Explain impact on task
   - ❌ Give long context
   - ❌ Provide options A/B/C
   - ❌ Write more than one sentence per question
   
   **⚠️ DO NOT proceed to Phase 3 until user answers.**

---

### Phase 2: Strategic Clarification (Ongoing)

4. **Strategic Questions → Ask User (as they arise)**
   - If questions concern:
     - Product vision or positioning
     - Business model decisions
     - Target market focus
     - Feature priorities
     - Go-to-market strategy
   - **Action**: Present strategic questions to user, wait for answers
   - **Save**: Document strategic decisions in `docs/decisions/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-decision.md`
     - Example: `11_02_Business-Model-decision.md`

---

### Phase 3: Deep Research (Iterative)

**⚠️ Only begin Phase 3 after user has answered your 3-5 clarifying questions from Phase 1**

5. **Research Planning**
   - Break down each research need into specific, answerable questions
   - Prioritize questions by importance to final output
   - Identify dependencies between questions (what must be answered first)
   - Create research roadmap

6. **First Research Iteration**
   - [ ] Ask expert about foundational questions (2-4 questions)
   - [ ] Save each Q&A in `docs/ask_expert/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-[date].md` with:
     - Date, Issue #, Task #, Purpose
     - Question with full context
     - Expert's answer
     - Key insights extracted
     - Follow-up questions identified
   
   **File Naming**: `[issue]_[task]_[topic]-[date].md`
   - Example: `10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-Nature-2025-11-22.md`

7. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - [ ] Review expert answers
   - [ ] Extract key facts, statistics, quotes
   - [ ] Identify contradictions or gaps in information
   - [ ] Cross-reference with existing documents
   - [ ] Determine if information is sufficient or if more research is needed
   - [ ] Document reasoning in `docs/reasoning/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-analysis.md`
     - Example: `10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-analysis.md`

   **⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKPOINT - Strategic Implications Assessment**
   
   After analyzing research, **STOP and ASK USER** if you discover anything suggesting Senior AI's tech, features, or offering should be modified:
   - New competitor info affecting positioning
   - Market insights shifting target segment
   - Technology trends changing feature emphasis
   - Pricing/business model implications
   - Regulatory/compliance impacts
   - User research contradicting assumptions
   
   **Format**: Present: What I Found → Current Position → Implication → Question with Options (A/B/C)
   
   **DO NOT proceed with writing** until strategic alignment is confirmed.

8. **Subsequent Research Iterations** (Repeat as needed)
   - [ ] Based on analysis, formulate follow-up questions
   - [ ] Ask expert about deeper or clarifying questions
   - [ ] Save new Q&As using same naming convention: `[issue]_[task]_[topic]-[date].md`
   - [ ] Synthesize new information with previous findings
   - [ ] Update reasoning document (same naming convention)
   - [ ] **Convergence check**: Can I now answer the original section requirements?
   
   **Iteration Guidelines**:
   - Typical: 2-4 iterations per complex topic
   - Each iteration should narrow focus or deepen understanding
   - Stop when: sufficient information to write confidently + defensibly

9. **Comparative Analysis** (when applicable)
   - [ ] Compare multiple sources or perspectives
   - [ ] Identify consensus vs. outlier views
   - [ ] Evaluate credibility and recency of information
   - [ ] Document comparison in `docs/reasoning/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-comparison.md`
     - Example: `10_03_Competitive-Advantages-comparison.md`

---

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Writing

10. **Create Synthesis Document**
   - [ ] Compile all research findings into `docs/synthesis/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-synthesis.md`
   - Include:
     - Key facts and statistics (with sources)
     - Main arguments and evidence
     - Competitive insights
     - Gaps that remain (if any)
     - Recommended narrative structure
   - This becomes the foundation for final writing
   - Example: `10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-synthesis.md`

11. **Draft Application Section**
    - [ ] Write draft in `docs/drafts/[issue]_[task]_[topic]-draft.md`
    - Use synthesis document as reference
    - Follow EIC formatting requirements (from template)
    - Ensure claims are backed by research
    - Include citations where appropriate
    - Match tone: professional, compelling, evidence-based
    - Example: `10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-draft.md`

12. **Quality Check**
    - [ ] Verify all claims have supporting evidence
    - [ ] Check for internal consistency with other sections
    - [ ] Ensure EIC evaluation criteria are addressed
    - [ ] Review against issue checklist
    - [ ] Flag any remaining uncertainties for user review

---

### Phase 5: Review & Finalization

13. **Present to User**
    - [ ] Share chat summary covering:
      - **Research conducted**: Topics explored, iterations completed
      - **Key findings**: Most important insights discovered
      - **Decisions made**: How research informed writing
      - **Draft status**: What's complete, what needs review
      - **Remaining questions**: Any strategic items for user
    - [ ] Provide links to all created documents
    - [ ] Request feedback on draft

14. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
    - [ ] Address user comments
    - [ ] Do additional research if needed
    - [ ] Refine draft
    - [ ] Update synthesis and reasoning docs

15. **Finalize**
    - [ ] Move approved content to final location
    - [ ] Update issue checklist (mark completed tasks)
    - [ ] Archive research documents for reference
    - [ ] Note any insights useful for other sections

## Document Organization

**File Naming Convention**: All documents follow `[issue]_[task]_[description].md` format

```
docs/
├── 00. Instructions.md (this file)
├── 01. Description.md (project overview)
├── ask_expert/
│   ├── 10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-Nature-2025-11-22.md
│   └── ...
├── decisions/
│   ├── 10_01_Visual-vs-Voice-First-decision.md
│   └── ...
├── reasoning/
│   ├── 10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-analysis.md
│   └── ...
├── synthesis/
│   ├── 10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-synthesis.md
│   └── ...
└── drafts/
    ├── 10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-draft.md
    └── ...
```

**Naming Pattern**: `[issue]_[task]_[description]-[variant].md`
- Issue 10, Task 1: `10_01_Innovation-Breakthrough-[variant].md`
- Issue 11, Task 2: `11_02_Business-Model-[variant].md`

## Key Principles

- **Depth over speed**: Take time to gather comprehensive information
- **Evidence-based**: Every claim should have supporting research or data
- **Iterative refinement**: Expect to research → reason → research again
- **Transparent reasoning**: Document why conclusions were reached
- **User involvement**: Strategic decisions involve user, tactical research uses expert
- **Traceability**: Anyone should be able to follow research → reasoning → draft
- **EIC focus**: Always keep EIC evaluation criteria in mind
- **⚠️ STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT FIRST**: If research suggests changing Senior AI's tech/offering, STOP and ASK USER before proceeding
- **🎯 SHORT QUESTIONS ONLY**: When asking user, keep questions to ONE sentence each - no explanations

---

## Example: Working on "Market Opportunity" Section

1. ✅ Read Description.md + Competitive Landscape Report
2. 🔍 Identify gaps: European market size, pricing, user preferences
3. ❓ **STOP - Ask 5 SHORT questions**:
   - "Should we target all 65+ or focus on 75+?"
   - "B2C subscription or B2B2C partnerships as primary?"
   - "Pricing: premium (€50+) or accessible (€20-30)?"
   - "Launch geography: Nordic first or broader EU?"
   - "Do we have any user research or pilot data yet?"
4. ⏸️ **WAIT for answers** (no explanation needed from user)
5. ✅ User answers: "75+, B2C primary, €39/mo, Nordic first, no pilots yet"
6. 📋 Create targeted research questions based on answers
7. 🤖 Ask expert → Save → Analyze (multiple iterations)
8. 🛑 **STOP**: Research shows 78% prefer voice-only, conflicts with visual-first approach
9. ❓ **Ask user**: Keep visual-first or pivot?
10. ✅ User confirms: "Keep visual-first, target the 22% who need it"
11. 🤖 Continue research with adjusted focus
12. 📝 Create synthesis → Write draft → Present summary

## When to Stop Researching

Stop when you can confidently answer:
- ✅ Do I have sufficient evidence for all claims?
- ✅ Can I defend this section to a skeptical evaluator?
- ✅ Are there credible sources for key statistics?
- ✅ Have I addressed all requirements in the issue checklist?
- ✅ Are there no major contradictions or gaps?

If answer is NO to any → Research another iteration
