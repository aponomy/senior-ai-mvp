# Team Hiring: Failure Modes & De-Risking

**Date**: 2025-11-23  
**Issue**: #12 - Implementation Plan & Team  
**Task**: 03 - Team Composition  
**Type**: Expert Consultation - Part 7a of 8

## Common Hiring Failure Modes

### 1. Vague Roles
**Problem**: Generalists who can't ship or meet milestones  
**De-risk**: Write role charters with 90-day outcomes tied to WP deliverables

### 2. Underestimating Notice Periods
**Problem**: Pilots slip, hires start late  
**De-risk**: Plan backward from pilot dates; assume 3–5 months

### 3. "Senior" But Not Hands-On
**Problem**: Need teams/process, lack startup pace  
**De-risk**: Use probation (provanställning 6 months); paid trial 4–6 weeks

### 4. Security/Privacy Bolted On Late
**Problem**: Buyers reject at DPIA/tender stage  
**De-risk**: Bake accessibility + security gates into CI/CD early

### 5. Weak Accessibility
**Problem**: Elderly users struggle, pilots fail  
**De-risk**: Hire UX/Accessibility in first 3; integrate tests in CI

### 6. Wrong BD Hire
**Problem**: Misreads tender cycles, no procurement exp  
**De-risk**: Prioritize municipal/region exp, upphandling knowledge; case study test

### 7. Contractor IP/DPA Issues
**Problem**: Risk to grant and contracts  
**De-risk**: Standard invention assignment + confidentiality in all agreements

### 8. Culture Misfit with Remote
**Problem**: Coordination cost explodes  
**De-risk**: Weekly cadence; Swedish for pilot/BD roles; Nordic remote for eng
