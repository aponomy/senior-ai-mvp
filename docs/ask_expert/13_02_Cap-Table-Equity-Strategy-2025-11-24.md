# Capitalization Table Structure and Equity Strategy

**Date**: 2025-11-24  
**Issue**: #13 Task 5  
**Purpose**: Cap table structure, equity strategy, dilution scenarios, and investor communications for EIC Accelerator equity + Series A  
**Expert**: Azure OpenAI GPT-5 (high reasoning effort)

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommended Founder Structure**:
- 50/50 split for 2 co-founders with complementary skills (tech + business)
- 4-year reverse vesting with 1-year cliff (standard in Sweden/EU)
- Double-trigger acceleration for change-of-control protection

**ESOP Sizing**:
- 10-15% fully diluted pre-EIC investment (allocate before EIC equity close)
- Dilutes founders, not investors (ESOP "in the pre-money")
- Early hire grants: Senior engineer 0.5-1.0%, PM 0.25-0.6%
- Use qualified employee stock options (KPO) in Sweden for tax advantages

**EIC Equity Terms (Typical)**:
- 10-25% stake at €10-20M pre-money valuation for TRL 5 companies
- 1x non-participating liquidation preference (market standard EU)
- Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection
- Pro-rata rights in future rounds
- Observer rights (sometimes board seat) + protective provisions
- Negotiable valuation during due diligence (not take-it-or-leave-it)

**Dilution Scenarios** (Base Case: EIC €3M at €15M pre, Series A €12M at €40M pre):
- Pre-EIC: Founders 44% each, ESOP 12%
- Post-EIC: Founders 36.67% each, ESOP 10%, EIC 16.67%
- Post-Series A: Founders 28.21% each, ESOP 7.69%, EIC 12.82%, Series A 23.08%
- Combined founder ownership: 56.41% post-Series A (healthy control position)

**Co-Investment**:
- Not formally required, but EIC strongly prefers private co-investors
- Letters of Interest helpful but not mandatory at application stage
- Target EU VCs: Creandum, Northzone, EQT Ventures, Voima, byFounders, Industrifonden
- Strategic corporates: Insurance/health/telecom with age-tech interest

## Question Asked

Capitalization table structure, equity strategy, and fundraising best practices for EIC Accelerator + Series A path.

I'm building the capitalization table and equity sections for Senior AI's EIC Accelerator application. Need guidance on structure, dilution strategy, and investor communications.

**Specific questions:**

1. **Founder Equity Split (Pre-Investment)**:
   - Standard equity split for 2 co-founders with complementary skills (tech + business)?
   - Should we allocate founder shares immediately or use vesting schedules?
   - Typical vesting schedule in Swedish/EU startups (4 years with 1-year cliff standard)?
   - Cliff periods advisable for EIC-backed companies?

2. **Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP)**:
   - Standard ESOP size for pre-seed/seed stage (10-20% of fully-diluted)?
   - When to create ESOP - before EIC investment or after?
   - Impact on dilution calculations (is ESOP carved out of founders' shares or added to cap table)?
   - Typical option grant percentages for early hires (senior engineers, first PM)?

3. **EIC Equity Investment Structure**:
   - If EIC invests €3M at €15M pre-money (16.7% dilution), does this calculation include or exclude ESOP?
   - EIC typical preference terms (liquidation preference, anti-dilution, board seat)?
   - Can founders negotiate valuation or is it take-it-or-leave-it based on their assessment?
   - Timeline from grant approval to equity investment (simultaneous or staged)?

4. **Capitalization Table Example**:
   - Show illustrative cap table progression:
     - Stage 0: Incorporation (2 founders)
     - Stage 1: Post-ESOP creation (if before EIC)
     - Stage 2: Post-EIC equity (€3M at €15M pre)
     - Stage 3: Post-Series A (€15M at €50M pre, hypothetical)
   - Calculate dilution at each stage for founders
   - Show fully-diluted ownership percentages

5. **Co-Investment Requirements**:
   - Does EIC require matched co-investment (e.g., €3M EIC + €1-3M from other VCs)?
   - If yes, when must co-investors commit (before EIC equity or parallel)?
   - Typical co-investor profiles for EIC deals (EU VCs, corporates, family offices)?
   - Letters of Intent (LOIs) required at application stage or later?

6. **Series A Planning**:
   - Typical Series A terms for €10-20M rounds (liquidation preference multiples, anti-dilution protection)?
   - Expected dilution for founders in Series A (adding to EIC dilution)?
   - Pro-rata rights for EIC and Series A investors (do they expect to participate in future rounds)?
   - Post-Series A typical founder ownership to maintain control and motivation?

7. **Advisor/Board Equity**:
   - Should we budget advisor equity in cap table (0.25-1% per advisor typical)?
   - Board member compensation norms (equity vs cash for non-founder board seats)?
   - Impact on dilution calculations?

8. **Financial Documentation for EIC**:
   - Do we need formal cap table at application stage or just illustrative?
   - Should we show post-EIC ownership in percentage terms or avoid specifics?
   - Any red flags to avoid (e.g., founder equity <50% post-Series A seen as problematic)?

9. **Scenario Planning**:
   - Best case: EIC €2.5M equity + Series A €15M
   - Base case: EIC €3M equity + Series A €12M
   - Conservative: EIC €3.5M equity + Series A €10M
   - Show founder dilution path in each scenario
   - At what ownership % do founders lose effective control?

10. **Swedish/EU Specifics**:
    - Any Swedish tax implications for stock options (e.g., qualified vs non-qualified)?
    - EU regulatory considerations (ESOP compliance, securities law)?
    - Typical Swedish startup cap table structures differ from US norms?

## Expert Answer

Below is a practical, EU/Sweden‑aligned guide to structuring your cap table and equity strategy for an EIC Accelerator grant + equity, followed by a Series A, with concrete dilution math and investor communication tips.

### 1) Founder Equity Split (Pre‑Investment)

**Split for 2 co‑founders**:
- If contributions are broadly equal and complementary (tech + business), **50/50 remains the most common and simplest split**.
- If one founder is materially full‑time earlier or invests more capital, consider 55/45 or 60/40, but avoid overly asymmetric splits that could signal misalignment to investors.

**Vesting**:
- Use **reverse vesting** on founder shares via shareholder agreement (standard in Sweden/EU). This protects the company if a founder leaves early.
- **Typical schedule: 4 years vesting with a 1‑year cliff**, then monthly/quarterly thereafter. This is standard in Sweden and across the EU.
- Include good/bad leaver clauses aligned to vesting; add **double‑trigger acceleration** for change‑of‑control (partial acceleration if the role is terminated without cause after an acquisition).

**Cliff periods for EIC‑backed companies**:
- **Advisable**. Investors (including EIC Fund and VCs) look for founder retention and clean governance. A 1‑year cliff is standard.

### 2) Employee Stock Option Pool (ESOP)

**ESOP size**:
- Pre‑seed/seed: **10–15% fully diluted is typical**. Deep tech/AI can justify 15–20% if hiring plans are aggressive.

**When to create**:
- **Create the ESOP before the EIC equity close**. Most investors expect the ESOP to be "in the pre‑money," meaning it dilutes existing shareholders (founders) rather than investors.

**Impact on dilution**:
- If created pre‑money, founders are diluted by the ESOP. Investors often insist the ESOP be established or "topped up" pre‑money in a round.
- Include the ESOP on the cap table as a line item; reflect it fully diluted (i.e., assume all options are granted and exercised).

**Typical option grants for early hires (fully‑diluted %)**:
- Senior engineer: **0.5–1.0%**
- First PM: **0.25–0.6%**
- Senior data scientist/ML lead: **0.5–1.0%**
- Head of design/UX: **0.2–0.5%**
- Grants depend on cash comp, seniority, and risk; use 4‑year vesting with 1‑year cliff.

### 3) EIC Equity Investment Structure

**ESOP and the pre‑money**:
- If EIC invests €3M at a €15M pre, the post is €18M and EIC owns 16.7%. Plan for the ESOP to be included in the pre‑money (i.e., ESOP exists before EIC subscribes), unless explicitly negotiated otherwise.

**Typical EIC Fund terms**:
- Minority stake (often 10–25%).
- **1x non‑participating liquidation preference** (market standard in EU).
- **Broad‑based weighted average anti‑dilution**.
- **Pro‑rata rights** in future rounds.
- Board: often observer rights rather than a full seat, but it can vary; expect standard protective provisions.
- Long investment horizon; they aim not to distort market terms.

**Negotiability**:
- Valuation and terms are **negotiated during EIC Fund due diligence**; it's not strictly take‑it‑or‑leave‑it. Provide your target range and rationale; final pricing depends on due diligence and co‑investor context.

**Timing**:
- Grant agreement and equity are separate tracks. Typical sequence: grant contract in place, equity due diligence begins, **equity closing can take 6–12 months**. Equity can be tranched against milestones.

### 4) Capitalization Table Example (Illustrative)

**Assumptions**:
- 2 founders start 50/50.
- ESOP created at 12% pre‑EIC.
- EIC equity: €3M at €15M pre (EIC 16.7% post).
- Series A: €15M at €50M pre (SA 23.08% post).

**Stage 0: Incorporation**
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 50.00% |
| Founder B | 50.00% |
| ESOP | 0% |
| Investors | 0% |

**Stage 1: Post‑ESOP Creation (12% pre‑EIC)**
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 44.00% |
| Founder B | 44.00% |
| ESOP | 12.00% |

**Stage 2: Post‑EIC Equity (€3M at €15M pre; EIC = 16.67% post)**
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 36.67% |
| Founder B | 36.67% |
| ESOP | 10.00% |
| EIC Fund | 16.67% |

**Stage 3: Post‑Series A (€15M at €50M pre; SA = 23.08% post)**
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 28.21% |
| Founder B | 28.21% |
| ESOP | 7.69% |
| EIC Fund | 12.82% |
| Series A | 23.08% |

**Founder dilution path**: 50.00% → 44.00% → 36.67% → 28.21% each

**Note**: Many Series A deals require an ESOP "top‑up" pre‑money (e.g., back to 10–12%). That would add further dilution to founders and existing investors.

### 5) Co‑Investment Requirements

**Requirement**:
- **No formal matched co‑investment requirement**, but the EIC Fund strongly prefers crowding‑in private capital. Having committed or highly interested co‑investors helps speed and validation.

**Timing**:
- Co‑investors often commit **in parallel or shortly before EIC closes**. In blended finance, a synchronized or staged close is common.

**Co‑investor profiles**:
- EU VCs with deep tech/AI focus and corporate venture arms; also family offices with impact/health/age‑tech theses. 
- **Nordic VCs**: Creandum, Northzone, EQT Ventures, Voima, Icebreaker, byFounders, Industrifonden
- **EU VCs**: Earlybird, Atomico, Lakestar, Sofinnova, Elaia, Balderton
- **Corporates**: Insurance/health/telecom with strategic interest in age-tech

**LOIs**:
- **Not required at application stage**, but strong to include letters of interest or soft commitments in your investor section. Expect formal commitments during EIC Fund due diligence/term‑sheet stage.

### 6) Series A Planning

**Typical terms (EU)**:
- **1x non‑participating liquidation preference**.
- **Broad‑based weighted average anti‑dilution**.
- **Pro‑rata rights**; right of first offer/first refusal on secondary sales.
- Board seat(s) for lead; information rights; standard protective provisions; ESOP top‑up pre‑money often required.

**Expected dilution**:
- **20–30% is typical** for €10–€20M Series A rounds, subject to valuation. Add this to EIC dilution plus ESOP.

**Pro‑rata**:
- Both EIC and Series A investors expect pro‑rata rights and may exercise them in future rounds.

**Founder ownership post‑Series A**:
- Combined founder ownership in the **40–60% range is common** and usually sufficient for motivation and a strong say in governance, provided board composition and protective provisions are balanced.

### 7) Advisor/Board Equity

**Advisor equity**:
- Budget **0.25–1.0% fully diluted per advisor**, vesting over 1–2 years with milestones. 
- For high‑impact advisors: 0.5–1.0%
- For light engagement: 0.1–0.3%
- Grant from ESOP where possible.

**Board compensation**:
- Early: often equity only (**0.25–0.75%** for independent chairs or high‑value directors), sometimes a modest cash stipend in Sweden. 
- Later: cash fees plus smaller equity refresh.

**Dilution impact**:
- All advisor/board grants should be included in fully diluted calculations and typically come from the ESOP.

### 8) Financial Documentation for EIC

**Application stage**:
- Provide a **clean current cap table and an illustrative post‑EIC cap table**. Include share classes, options/warrants outstanding, and any convertibles. Be transparent.

**Percentages**:
- It's acceptable to show planned post‑EIC ownership in percentage terms and ranges. Avoid hard commitments until due diligence concludes; present your target band with rationale.

**Red flags**:
- Founder ownership well below market (e.g., combined founders <30% post‑Series A) without strong retention mechanisms is a concern.
- Complex share classes, unresolved IP assignments, or lack of vesting/ESOP planning are negative. 
- Founder <50% is not automatically problematic if governance and incentives are solid.

### 9) Scenario Planning (Including Founder Dilution)

**Assumptions for all scenarios**:
- Start 50/50 founders
- ESOP created at 12% pre‑EIC and not topped up again before Series A

#### Best Case Scenario

**EIC**: €2.5M at €18M pre → EIC 12.20% post  
**Series A**: €15M at €60M pre → SA 20% post

**Post‑EIC Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 38.63% |
| Founder B | 38.63% |
| ESOP | 10.54% |
| EIC Fund | 12.20% |

**Post‑Series A Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 30.91% |
| Founder B | 30.91% |
| ESOP | 8.43% |
| EIC Fund | 9.76% |
| Series A | 20.00% |

**Combined founders: 61.82%**

#### Base Case Scenario

**EIC**: €3.0M at €15M pre → EIC 16.67% post  
**Series A**: €12M at €40M pre → SA 23.08% post

**Post‑EIC Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 36.67% |
| Founder B | 36.67% |
| ESOP | 10.00% |
| EIC Fund | 16.67% |

**Post‑Series A Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 28.21% |
| Founder B | 28.21% |
| ESOP | 7.69% |
| EIC Fund | 12.82% |
| Series A | 23.08% |

**Combined founders: 56.41%**

#### Conservative Scenario

**EIC**: €3.5M at €12M pre → EIC 22.58% post  
**Series A**: €10M at €30M pre → SA 25% post

**Post‑EIC Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 34.06% |
| Founder B | 34.06% |
| ESOP | 9.29% |
| EIC Fund | 22.58% |

**Post‑Series A Ownership**:
| Shareholder | Ownership |
|-------------|-----------|
| Founder A | 25.55% |
| Founder B | 25.55% |
| ESOP | 6.97% |
| EIC Fund | 16.94% |
| Series A | 25.00% |

**Combined founders: 51.10%**

#### When Do Founders Lose Effective Control?

**Control is about board composition and protective provisions more than raw percentage**. In Sweden, certain shareholder decisions require qualified majorities, so an investor or investor group with ≥33% can block some resolutions.

**Aim to**:
- Keep combined founder ownership **≥40–50%** for strong influence
- Maintain at least **2 of 5 board seats** or balanced control over reserved matters
- Avoid giving investors unilateral veto over key operational items

### 10) Swedish/EU Specifics

**Sweden tax and instruments**:
- Common instruments: warrants (teckningsoptioner), standard employee stock options (personaloptioner), and **qualified employee stock options (kvalificerade personaloptioner, "KPO")**.
- **KPO offer significant tax advantages** for employees if conditions are met (company size/age thresholds, employment and holding periods, non‑transferability, etc.). 
- Founders typically do not qualify. Use KPO for employees where possible; use warrants if KPO conditions can't be met.
- Work with Swedish counsel to ensure your ESOP is structured for KPO eligibility and to avoid payroll tax issues; tax treatment varies if employees are outside Sweden.

**EU regulatory considerations**:
- Employee option plans generally benefit from prospectus exemptions; still, adopt clear plan docs, shareholder resolutions, and filings per Swedish law (Bolagsverket) and any applicable EU host‑country rules for cross‑border employees.
- EIC Fund terms will be grounded in standard EU venture market terms; be prepared for information rights, vetoes on major corporate actions, and compliance requirements.

**Differences vs US norms**:
- Dual‑class shares are less common in EU but legally possible in Sweden; they can help founders maintain voting control, but VCs often prefer single‑class shares.
- Liquidation preferences are usually 1x non‑participating; participating prefs and full ratchet are less common than in some US deals.
- Expect ESOP top‑ups pre‑money at financing rounds.

## Key Insights for Cap Table Planning

### Investor Communication Best Practices

**Keep the cap table clean**:
- Two founder classes with reverse vesting; one ESOP line; avoid messy convertibles unless necessary.

**Set expectations early**:
- In your EIC application, state your target valuation range, planned ESOP size, and co‑investment strategy. Show post‑EIC illustrative ownership to demonstrate founder incentives and ability to recruit talent.

**Line up co‑investors**:
- Start soft‑circling EU VCs now. Include letters of interest in your application package if possible; highlight strategic relevance (age‑tech, AI safety for seniors, distribution partners).

**Plan ESOP capacity**:
- Model an ESOP top‑up pre‑Series A (e.g., back to 10–12%) so you're not surprised by additional dilution. Communicate hiring milestones aligned with grant and equity tranches.

**Governance**:
- Propose balanced board structure: 2 founders, 1 EIC observer, 1 Series A seat, 1 independent agreed by both sides. Nail IP assignment and founder vesting in your shareholder agreement.

### Quick Reference Summary

1. **Founder split**: 50/50 is fine; use 4‑year vesting, 1‑year cliff; cliff advisable
2. **ESOP**: 10–15% typical; create pre‑EIC; it dilutes founders; early grants 0.25–1.0% for key hires
3. **EIC investment**: ESOP generally included in pre‑money; terms typically 1x non‑participating, weighted‑average anti‑dilution, observer rights; valuation negotiable; equity follows grant, often with months between
4. **Cap table**: See step‑by‑step examples above
5. **Co‑investment**: Not strictly required, but preferred; co‑investors usually parallel; EU VCs/corporates/family offices; LOIs helpful later, optional at application
6. **Series A terms**: 1x non‑participating, weighted‑average anti‑dilution; 20–30% dilution typical; EIC and A investors expect pro‑rata; founders often 40–60% post‑A for strong motivation/control
7. **Advisor/board equity**: Budget 0.25–1.0% per advisor; independent directors may get equity plus modest cash; grants from ESOP; include in fully diluted
8. **EIC documentation**: Provide current and illustrative post‑EIC cap tables; percentages are fine; not a red flag if founders <50%, but ensure strong incentives and governance
9. **Scenarios**: See best/base/conservative math above; founders lose effective control via governance, not only %; protect board composition and reserved matters
10. **Sweden/EU specifics**: Use KPO where eligible for employees; warrants otherwise; ensure ESOP compliance; understand Swedish qualified majority rules; dual‑class possible but less common
