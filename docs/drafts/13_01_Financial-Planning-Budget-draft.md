## Part C: Financial Plan Overview (Narrative for Main Application)

### C.1 Grant Budget Summary (TRL 5→8 Development Phase)

Senior AI requests **€2.5M in grant funding** over 18 months to advance from TRL 5 (working prototype validated in relevant environment) to TRL 8 (system complete and qualified). This funding enables systematic engineering, certification, and real-world validation necessary to transform our innovative elderly-focused AI assistant into a production-ready, certified platform deployable at scale.

**Budget Allocation**:
- **Personnel (71%)**: €1,780k for 7-8 full-time equivalent engineers plus founders, covering platform engineering, ML/AI development, accessibility design, security architecture, and pilot program management
- **Subcontracting (13%)**: €320k for specialized external services including security audits, accessibility certification, user testing with elderly participants, and compliance consulting
- **Direct Costs (12%)**: €300k for equipment, travel, software licenses, and pilot deployment infrastructure
- **Contingency (4%)**: €100k risk buffer for scope changes and unforeseen compliance requirements

This budget reflects **Swedish market rates** (median salaries with 1.45× loaded costs for social charges and benefits) and **market-validated external service costs** for security, accessibility, and AI compliance in the EU. The allocation emphasizes personnel (71%) appropriate for a deep-tech development phase requiring specialized skills in elderly UX, AI safety, and regulatory compliance.

**Key Justifications**:
- **Security investment (€130k total)** reflects high stakes of vulnerable user population and BankID integration requirements
- **Accessibility investment (€145k total)** necessary for EN 301 549 certification and elderly-specific usability validation with 60-80 participants
- **Pilot program investment (€250k)** enables real-world validation across 10-15 sites in Sweden, Norway, and Germany
- **Founder salaries included (€130k combined)** per EIC guidance on sustainable project management and auditability

### C.2 Revenue Model & Path to Profitability

Senior AI employs a **dual revenue stream model** combining B2C subscriptions and B2B2C partnerships:

**B2C Subscription Tiers**:
- Basic (€9.90/month): Budget-conscious users, essential features
- Plus (€14.90/month): Mainstream tier with full BankID integration and unlimited usage
- Premium (€19.90/month): Power users with family coordination features
- **Blended ARPU: €11-14/month** (€130-165/year)

**B2B2C Wholesale Channels**:
- **Municipalities** (€6-9/user/month): Digital inclusion programs, procurement-friendly pricing at 60-70% discount to retail
- **Care Providers** (€6-8/user/month): ROI pitch versus €2,250/year human assistance costs
- **Health Insurers** (€7-12/user/month PMPM): Preventive care reimbursement, outcome-based contracts
- **Telecom Operators** (€4-6/user/month): Bundle partners, CSR/accessibility value

**5-Year Revenue Trajectory**:

| Year | MAU | B2C% | B2B2C% | ARPU | Revenue | Growth | EBITDA% |
|------|-----|------|--------|------|---------|--------|---------|
| N (2026) | 10k | 70% | 30% | €110 | €1.1M | - | 8% |
| N+1 (2027) | 40k | 65% | 35% | €120 | €4.8M | 336% | 18% |
| N+2 (2028) | 120k | 55% | 45% | €130 | €15.6M | 225% | 38% |
| N+3 (2029) | 270k | 50% | 50% | €140 | €37.8M | 142% | 49% |
| N+4 (2030) | 475k | 45% | 55% | €135 | €64.1M | 70% | 52% |

**Break-even**: Year 2-3 at 40-66k MAU (EBITDA positive)  
**Self-funded from Year 3**: No additional equity required beyond Series A

**Geographic Rollout**:
- **Phase 1 (Year 1-2)**: Sweden, Norway, Germany (BankID/EUDI wallet ready markets)
- **Phase 2 (Year 3-4)**: UK, Netherlands, Denmark (established digital ID infrastructure)
- **Phase 3 (Year 5)**: France, Belgium, Austria (localization playbook proven)

Sequential rollout (€250-300k per language/market) minimizes upfront capital while validating go-to-market fit in each geography.

### C.3 Unit Economics & Scalability

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**: €375-562
- ARPU: €120-150/year (blending B2C and B2B2C)
- Retention: 70-80% annually (20-30% churn from mortality, institutionalization, health decline)
- Lifespan: 2.5-4.2 years
- Gross margin: 75-85% at scale (Year 3+)

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: €75-150 blended
- B2C digital: €120-200 (improving to €100-150 by Year 3 via referrals)
- B2C partnerships: €50-100 (pensioner associations, pharmacies, libraries)
- B2B2C: €20-80 (bulk deals, lower per-user CAC)

**LTV:CAC Ratio**: 3:1 by Year 2 (healthy), scaling to 5-7:1 by Year 5 (excellent)

**Payback Period**: 12-18 months (Year 1-2) → 10 months (Year 3+)

**Infrastructure Economics**:
- **Per-user COGS** (monthly): €0.30-0.60 (LLM APIs + cloud + observability)
- **Scale efficiency**: 
  - 10k MAU: €4-6/user/month infrastructure → 60-70% gross margin
  - 100k MAU: €2-3/user/month → 75-80% gross margin
  - 500k MAU: €1.5-2.5/user/month → 80-85% gross margin
- **Optimization levers**: 80/20 model mix (GPT-4o-mini/Claude), context compression, edge STT, caching

**Software-Only Advantage**:
- Zero manufacturing costs, inventory, or logistics (versus hardware competitors like ElliQ, Komp)
- SaaS margin profile (75-85%) versus hardware-dependent models (35-50%)
- Rapid geographic expansion without physical distribution

### C.4 Equity Investment Requirements

### C.7 Financial Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Revenue ramp slower than projected** | - Conservative MAU targets (1-2% market penetration)<br>- Focus on B2B2C for predictable contract revenue<br>- Maintain 18-24 months runway at all times |
| **CAC higher than elderly tech benchmarks** | - Prioritize partnership channels (€50-100 vs €120-200 digital)<br>- Build referral programs (adult children as advocates)<br>- Content marketing for long-tail organic acquisition |
| **Churn higher than modeled (>30% annually)** | - Habit-forming use cases (BankID monthly banking tasks)<br>- Family involvement features (caregiver portals reduce abandonment)<br>- Proactive onboarding support (phone, workshops) |
| **Infrastructure costs scale poorly** | - Multi-cloud strategy (Cloudflare + Supabase flexibility)<br>- LLM optimization (80% mini, 20% Sonnet; context compression)<br>- Monthly unit economics monitoring with alerts |
| **Municipal pilot-to-contract conversion fails** | - Legal/procurement support budgeted (€45k)<br>- Direct-award threshold strategies (below €100k for speed)<br>- ROI documentation from pilot phase |
| **Series A timing delayed or valuation lower** | - Break-even by Year 3 (self-funded from operations)<br>- €16.5M cash post-Year 2 = 39 months runway<br>- Bridge financing options (venture debt, revenue-based financing) if needed |
| **Co-investor commitment fails to materialize** | - ALMI discussions advanced (strong likelihood)<br>- EIC can proceed without co-investors (no formal requirement)<br>- Multiple VC conversations in parallel (not single-threaded) |

**Downside Scenario (Conservative Case)**:
- MAU growth 20% lower: 380k MAU Year 5 (vs 475k base)
- EIC equity at higher dilution: 22.6% (vs 16.67%)
- Series A at lower valuation: €30M pre (vs €40M)
- **Result**: Break-even delayed 6-9 months; founders 51% combined post-Series A (still strong control)

**Financial stress-tested**: Even in conservative case, runway maintained >18 months, profitability achieved Year 3-4, no "down round" risk.

### C.8 Impact & European Added Value (Financial Lens)

**Cost Savings to EU Healthcare & Social Systems**:
- **Aging-in-place enablement**: Delaying institutionalization by 12-18 months for 2% of users (10k at 500k scale)
  - 10,000 users × €35,000/year LTC cost = **€350M/year avoided costs**
  - Senior AI cost: 500k users × €135 ARPU = €67.5M/year
  - **Net savings ratio: 5:1**

- **Digital exclusion reduction**: 
  - Swedish municipalities spend €500-2,000/participant/year on digital inclusion programs (in-person training)
  - Senior AI B2B2C: €72-108/user/year (80-95% cost reduction)
  - At 100k municipal users: €50-190M/year savings to public budgets

- **Family caregiver time savings**:
  - Average 5-10 hours/month tech support by family members (€30-50/hour opportunity cost)
  - Senior AI reduces to 1-2 hours/month
  - 300k users × 6 hours saved × €40/hour × 12 months = **€864M/year** family time value

**Job Creation** (EU, 5 years):
- Direct: 95 FTEs (Sweden, Germany, UK, Netherlands)
- Indirect: 150-200 (localization, support, partnerships)
- Tax revenue: €3-5M/year (Year 5) from profitable operations

**European Data Sovereignty**:
- GDPR-first architecture (versus US/Asian competitors)
- EU cloud infrastructure (Cloudflare/Supabase EU regions)
- Sets standard for ethical AI for vulnerable populations

**Alignment with EU Digital Decade 2030**:
- Target: 80% digital skills by 2030
- Current: 65-74 age group at 30-40% (40-50pp gap)
- Senior AI impact: +30-50pp digital service usage among users
- 475k users at 40pp improvement = 190k elderly EU citizens achieving digital skills target
