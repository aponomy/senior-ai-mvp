## Budget & Grant Amount Questions

### Q1: "Why €2.5M? Couldn't you do this with less?"

**Answer**:
"Every euro is allocated to critical TRL 5→8 advancement activities:

- **71% personnel** (€1.78M) covers Swedish market rates for specialized skills we cannot compromise on: elderly-specific UX design, AI safety for vulnerable users, BankID integration expertise, and accessibility engineering. These are not generic development roles.

- **13% external services** (€320k) are mandated for certification: EN 301 549 accessibility audit (€50k), ISO/IEC 42001 AI management (€60k), security penetration testing (€70k), GDPR/DPIA compliance (€25k), and user testing with 60-80 elderly participants (€35k).

- **12% infrastructure** (€300k) enables 10-15 real-world pilot sites across Sweden, Norway, and Germany - essential for TRL 8 validation.

Reducing the budget risks TRL 8 achievement and, critically, safety for vulnerable elderly users. We've already optimized by deferring patents, maintaining hybrid work, and excluding advisor equity."

---

### Q2: "Your Year 1-2 burn rate is high versus revenue. Why should we fund this?"

**Answer**:
"This is standard deep-tech trajectory. Year 1-2 are focused on achieving TRL 8, certifications, and pilot validation - not revenue maximization. However, our financial profile is actually **stronger than typical enterprise SaaS**:

- **Break-even Year 3** at 66k MAU is **faster than typical B2B SaaS** (usually Year 4-5)
- Our **software-only model** with 95% gross margins enables rapid profitability once market fit is proven
- By end of Year 2, we'll have **€16M+ in cash** (39 months runway) from EIC + Series A, removing 'Series B or die' pressure
- **EBITDA positive by Year 2** (€870k, 18% margin) - many startups take 5+ years

The EIC grant de-risks the certification and compliance phase, which is capital-intensive but non-negotiable for elderly users and municipal procurement."

---

### Q3: "Can you justify the founder salaries during the grant phase?"

**Answer**:
"Yes. We're budgeting **55k SEK/month (€4,783) per founder at 75% time** = €130k combined over 18 months.

This is:
- **At market rate** for technical founders in Sweden (55k for 75% time = 73.3k SEK/month full-time equivalent, aligned with market median of 70-75k SEK)
- **Recommended by EIC guidance** for project sustainability and auditability
- **Essential for full commitment** - we cannot execute an 18-month TRL 8 program while working other jobs

We've already been working part-time without salary to reach TRL 5. The grant phase requires full commitment to lead 7-8 FTEs, manage pilots, and ensure certification success. Zero founder salary creates sustainability risk that evaluators typically flag."

## Growth & Revenue Questions

### Q4: "How realistic is 336% growth from Year 1 to Year 2?"

**Answer**:
"This is actually **conservative versus SaaS benchmarks**:

- **Top-quartile SaaS companies** follow T2D3 trajectory: Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double = 300-500% early-year growth
- Our growth is **driven by B2B2C contracts**, not just viral B2C adoption
- We have **10-15 municipal pilots** starting in Year 1; converting 50-70% to 3-5 year contracts (1-5k users each) gives us 15-30k B2B2C users alone
- **B2C growth** (8k users) is supplemental organic growth
- Total: 10k → 40k MAU = 300% growth, **de-risked by contracted B2B2C revenue**

Importantly, our Year 2-3 growth moderates to 200-225%, showing sustainable scaling rather than unsustainable hockey stick."

---

### Q5: "Your market penetration is only 1-2% by Year 5. Why so conservative?"

**Answer**:
"This **demonstrates realistic planning**, not lack of ambition:

- **TAM**: €6-14B (109M elderly EU citizens × €55-130/year average spending potential)
- **Year 5 revenue**: €64M = 0.5-1% of TAM, or **1.3-2.6% of addressable SAM** (those with smartphones/internet)
- For comparison, **ElliQ** (US market leader) has ~50k users after 5 years in a 55M elderly population = 0.09% penetration
- Our 475k users / 109M elderly = **0.4% total EU penetration** - highly conservative for a multi-country rollout

We believe actual penetration could reach 3-5% (1.5-2.5M users), but conservative projections reduce execution risk and ensure fundability. If we hit these 'conservative' targets, we have a **€2-5B valuation potential**."

## Equity & Dilution Questions

### Q6: "Founder ownership drops to 28% each post-Series A. Isn't this a motivation concern?"

**Answer**:
"**Combined 56% post-Series A maintains strong control and motivation**:

**From governance perspective**:
- 56% combined gives us board control (2 of 5 seats), veto rights on major decisions, and qualified majority protection
- Swedish corporate law gives shareholders >33% blocking rights on key resolutions
- We maintain founder-friendly protective provisions

**From economic perspective**:
- 28% each of €52M post-money = **€14.6M value per founder**
- Versus 50% of €0 today = €0
- At Year 5 (€64M ARR, 52% EBITDA margin), comparable SaaS companies trade at 8-12× revenue = **€500-750M valuation**
- 28% of €600M = **€168M per founder** - extremely motivating

**From talent perspective**:
- 12% ESOP allows us to recruit senior talent (0.5-1% grants)
- Undercapitalized ESOPs (<10%) force us to dilute founders further in future rounds

This is a **standard, healthy dilution path** for a deep-tech company with proper funding."

---

### Q7: "Why do you need both EIC equity AND a Series A?"

**Answer**:
"They serve **different strategic purposes at different stages**:

**EIC Equity (€3M, Year 1)**: 
- Bridges TRL 8 → market launch (Month 12-24)
- Funds team scaling from 10 → 22 FTEs
- Finances initial customer acquisition (pilots → contracts)
- Covers platform scaling infrastructure
- **Purpose**: Prove product-market fit with 30-50k MAU

**Series A (€12M, Year 3)**:
- Occurs **after break-even** (de-risked for investors)
- Funds international expansion (DACH, UK, Nordics beyond Sweden/Norway)
- Scales sales & marketing organization (€5M CAC spend)
- Grows team to 50 FTEs
- **Purpose**: Scale proven model to 250-300k MAU

**Without Series A**: We would still reach profitability (Year 3) but grow more slowly (organic growth only). Series A **accelerates** market capture in a competitive window (2-3 years before Big Tech enters). This is **not a 'Series B or die' situation** - we're profitable, just choosing to scale faster with institutional capital."

## Risk & Mitigation Questions

### Q8: "What if municipal pilot-to-contract conversion rates are only 30% instead of 50-70%?"

**Answer**:
"We've **stress-tested this scenario**:

**Base case** (50-70% conversion):
- 10-15 pilots → 5-10 contracts (1-5k users each) = 15-30k B2B2C users Year 2

**Downside case** (30% conversion):
- 10-15 pilots → 3-5 contracts = 9-15k B2B2C users Year 2
- Shortfall: 10-15k users

**Mitigation**:
- **Increase B2C focus**: Shift €500k from B2B2C sales to B2C marketing (lower CAC via partnerships)
- **Add 5-10 additional pilots in Year 2**: €50k per pilot, funded from operational cash flow
- **Extend pilot duration**: 6→9 months for slower-moving procurement processes
- **Target smaller municipalities**: Direct-award thresholds (<€100k) avoid lengthy tenders
- **Outcome**: Still achieve 35-40k MAU Year 2 (vs. 40k target), maintaining break-even trajectory

**Importantly**: We've budgeted €45k for legal/procurement support specifically to increase conversion rates through better tender navigation."

### Q9: "Your churn assumptions are 20-30% annually. What if elderly user churn is actually 40-50%?"

**Answer**:
"We've modeled this carefully against **elderly-specific benchmarks**:

**Our 20-30% assumption is conservative**:
- **Telecare services** in UK: 15-20% annual churn (Age UK, Lifeline24 data)
- **Streaming services** for 65+: 18-25% churn (Ofcom 2023)
- **Our churn drivers**: Mortality (~3%), institutionalization (~5%), cognitive decline requiring higher-touch care (~7%), economic hardship (~5%), simply not finding value (~5-10%)

**If churn reaches 40-50%** (pessimistic):
- **LTV drops** from €375-562 to €225-340 (retention 50-60%, lifespan 1.7-2.5 years)
- **LTV:CAC ratio** drops from 3-6:1 to 1.5-2.8:1 (still acceptable for early-stage SaaS)
- **Break-even delayed** 6-9 months (Year 3 Q3 instead of Q1)

**Mitigation already built in**:
- **Habit-forming use cases**: BankID monthly banking tasks create sticky, essential behavior
- **Family involvement**: Caregiver portals reduce 'abandonment' churn (family renews even if primary user declining)
- **Onboarding investment**: €50k budgeted for phone support, workshops, reducing early churn
- **Proactive outreach**: Predictive churn models identify at-risk users for intervention

**Real-world validation**: Our 20+ elderly test users showed **zero churn over 6 months** - early signal our engagement model works."

### Q10: "What if LLM API costs increase 50-100% due to pricing changes?"

**Answer**:
"We have **multiple mitigation levers**:

**Current cost structure** (per user/month):
- LLM APIs: €0.18-0.36 (80% GPT-4o-mini, 20% Claude Sonnet)
- Infrastructure: €0.10-0.20 (Cloudflare, Supabase)
- **Total COGS**: €0.30-0.60/user/month

**If LLM costs double** (+€0.18-0.36):
- **New COGS**: €0.48-0.96/user/month (€5.76-11.52/year)
- **Impact on gross margin**: 95% → 92-93% (still excellent for SaaS)
- **Impact on EBITDA**: Year 5 EBITDA drops from 52% to 50% (€1.3M impact on €64M revenue)

**Mitigation strategies** (can implement in 3-6 months):
1. **Model optimization**: Reduce Claude share 20%→10%, increase GPT-4o-mini to 90% (saves 50% of increase)
2. **Context compression**: Implement prompt engineering to reduce token usage 20-30%
3. **Edge inference**: Deploy smaller models locally/edge for routine intents (calendar, reminders)
4. **Caching**: Cache common responses (weather, news, FAQ) at CDN layer
5. **Rate limiting**: Gentle usage caps for abusive patterns (extreme edge cases)
6. **Pricing adjustment**: Pass through €0.50-1.00/month ARPU increase (customers tolerate small increases for maintained service quality)

**Strategic hedge**: Multi-cloud, multi-model strategy allows us to shift to lower-cost providers (Gemini, Mistral) if pricing becomes predatory."

## Co-Investment & Series A Questions

### Q11: "What if you can't secure co-investors alongside EIC equity?"

**Answer**:
"**EIC can proceed without co-investors** (no formal matching requirement), but we're **confident in securing co-investment**:

**Current status**:
- **ALMI Invest**: Active discussions, €1.0-1.5M target (Swedish government-backed investor with strong age-tech interest)
- **Nordic VCs**: Soft-circling Creandum, Northzone, EQT Ventures, byFounders, Voima for €0.5-1.5M

**Why co-investors are interested**:
- Large addressable market (€6-14B)
- Strong EU policy alignment (Digital Decade 2030, European Accessibility Act)
- GDPR moat versus US/Asian competitors
- Municipal partnerships create predictable B2B2C revenue
- Proven founders with TRL 5 achieved

**If co-investment fails**:
- EIC €3M alone covers Year 1-2 burn
- **Adjust growth trajectory**: Reduce Year 2 CAC spend by €500k (grow to 30-35k MAU instead of 40k)
- **Extend Series A timeline**: Month 30 instead of 24, come to market with 80-100k MAU instead of 120k (stronger traction)
- **Result**: Slightly slower growth but same destination - actually **reduces risk** by proving more before Series A

**Not having co-investors is not a blocker**, just a 'nice-to-have' for faster scaling."

### Q12: "Your Series A assumptions are €12M at €40M pre-money. What if valuations compress?"

**Answer**:
"We've **modeled multiple scenarios**:

**Best case**: €15M at €60M pre (bull market, competitive process)
- Founders: 30.9% each post-Series A
- Cash: €27M, runway 50+ months

**Base case**: €12M at €40M pre (current plan)
- Founders: 28.2% each post-Series A  
- Cash: €24M, runway 39 months

**Conservative case**: €10M at €30M pre (bear market, single-offer)
- Founders: 25.6% each post-Series A
- Cash: €22M, runway 34 months

**All scenarios are fundable and achieve break-even**. The conservative case simply means:
- **Slower international expansion** (focus on DACH + Nordics, defer UK/France to Year 4)
- **Tighter CAC efficiency** (prioritize B2B2C with €20-80 CAC over B2C at €150+)
- **Leaner team scaling** (40 FTEs instead of 50 in Year 3)
- **Result**: €50M revenue Year 5 instead of €64M - still a **€400-600M valuation company**

**Importantly**: By Year 3 (Series A timing), we'll be **EBITDA positive and self-funded**. Series A is for acceleration, not survival. If valuations are terrible, **we can delay 6-12 months** and raise at scale (150-200k MAU) for better terms."

## European Value Questions

### Q13: "How do you quantify the €350M avoided LTC costs claim?"

**Answer**:
"This is based on **conservative, well-documented assumptions**:

**Elderly institutionalization economics**:
- **Long-term care cost**: €35,000/year/person (EU average: Sweden €45k, Poland €25k)
- **Source**: OECD Health Statistics 2023, Eurostat disability data

**Aging-in-place enablement**:
- Senior AI enables **2% of users** to delay institutionalization by 12-18 months (conservative)
- **Mechanism**: Digital independence (banking, healthcare access, government services) + safety features (scam protection, medication reminders) + family coordination reduces 'emergency placement' scenarios
- **At 500k users**: 2% = 10,000 users × €35k/year × 1.25 years average = **€437M avoided costs**
- We conservatively cite **€350M** (80% of calculated value to account for attribution challenges)

**Comparison to Senior AI cost**:
- 500k users × €135 ARPU = €67.5M/year Senior AI revenue
- **Net savings ratio**: €350M / €67.5M = **5.2:1 ROI to healthcare systems**

**Validation**:
- UK NHS studies: Technology Enabled Care (TEC) shows €2-4 saved per €1 spent on remote monitoring/digital assistance for elderly
- Our 5:1 ratio is **within validated ranges** and accounts for only 2% of users (the most at-risk segment)"

---

### Q14: "Why should EIC fund this instead of letting private market do it?"

**Answer**:
"**Market failure + European strategic necessity**:

**Market failure**:
- US competitors (ElliQ, Amazon Alexa) prioritize **surveillance capitalism** model (data monetization) incompatible with GDPR
- Asian alternatives (Alibaba, Tencent) face EU data sovereignty barriers
- European Big Tech (Nokia, Ericsson) not entering elderly consumer AI market
- **Result**: 70-85M elderly Europeans with inadequate digital skills, no privacy-preserving solution

**EIC catalytic role**:
- **TRL 5→8 valley of death**: €2.5M grant covers certification (EN 301 549, ISO 42001) and pilot validation that VCs won't fund pre-revenue
- **De-risks private investment**: EIC equity + co-investors enable Series A at scale
- **Without EIC**: We'd need to raise €8-10M pre-seed (unrealistic for pre-revenue) or bootstrap for 4-5 years (market window closes)

**European strategic value**:
- **Digital Decade 2030**: 40-65 percentage point skills gap for 65+ requires scalable solutions, not incremental municipal programs
- **European Accessibility Act** (June 2025): Creates regulatory moat for certified EU solutions
- **GDPR sovereignty**: Senior AI sets standard for privacy-preserving AI for vulnerable populations
- **Job creation**: 95 direct FTEs (EU), 150-200 indirect (localization, support, partnerships)

**EIC investment creates a European champion** in a strategic market ($20B+ global elderly tech by 2030), where failure means elderly EU citizens using Chinese or US surveillance tech."

## Summary: Core Messages for Evaluators

**Financial Plan Strength**:
1. **Necessary budget**: Every euro allocated to TRL 8, not gold-plating
2. **Strong unit economics**: 95% gross margins, LTV:CAC 3-6:1, break-even Year 3
3. **Multiple revenue streams**: B2C + B2B2C diversification reduces risk
4. **Realistic assumptions**: Conservative market penetration, validated churn rates, stress-tested downside scenarios
5. **Founder-friendly dilution**: 56% combined ownership post-Series A maintains control
6. **Self-funded trajectory**: Series A accelerates growth, not required for survival
7. **European impact**: €350M LTC savings, 190k elderly achieving digital skills, GDPR sovereignty

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Software-only model** (vs. hardware competitors) = superior margins + rapid scaling
- **Dual go-to-market** (B2C + B2B2C) = predictable B2B2C contracts + viral B2C referrals
- **Certified from day 1** (EN 301 549, ISO 42001) = municipal procurement advantage
- **GDPR moat** = European alternative to US/Asian surveillance capitalism

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Conservative assumptions throughout (1-2% market penetration, 20-30% churn, 50-70% pilot conversion)
- Multiple mitigation strategies for every identified risk
- Break-even by Year 3 removes 'Series B or die' pressure
- 18-24 months runway maintained at all times
