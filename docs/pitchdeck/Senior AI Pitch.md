---

### Slide 1: Title & Breakthrough Vision

# Senior AI
**The Accessible Gateway to AI for 125M Elderly Europeans**

### Create • Learn • Explore • Execute

| EU-Sovereign | Cognitive-Accessible | 14+ Domains |

# Why Now: The Mandate for Inclusion
**🤖 AI Revolution:** Thousands of tools are inaccessible to elderly users.
**🇪🇺 Accessibility Act:** June 2025 compliance deadline is approaching.
**📊 Digital Decade 2030:** Requires **80% digital skills**, facing a massive 40-50 percentage point gap in the elderly population.

# Proven Results (TRL 5 Validation)
### **2× Task Completion**
### **50% Less Cognitive Load** (NASA-TLX: 3.2 vs. 6.8)
### **80% Fewer Errors** (0.8–1.2 vs. 4–6 critical errors per task)
### **30+ Turn Context** (vs. 3-5 turns for competitors)

### Slide 2: The Problem – Digital Exclusion at Scale

# 70-85M Elderly Europeans
**Left Behind by TWO Revolutions**

### The Crisis: Essential Services Going Digital
*   **Banking:** 25-30% branch closures, with BankID mandatory for Swedish banking.
*   **Healthcare:** E-prescriptions are mandatory, and 1177 Sweden requires digital access.
*   **Government:** 80-90% services are digital-only.
*   **Result:** **40-60%** of elderly users abandon multi-step digital tasks mid-process or require human assistance.

### The AI Revolution is Inaccessible
*   Thousands of powerful AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Perplexity, Adobe Firefly) are **too complex** to find, understand, or use.
*   **Result:** Elderly users are excluded from creativity, learning, and exploration. An additional **50 million** Europeans with ADHD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or early dementia face identical barriers.

# Current Solutions Fail the Cognitive Test
*   **Alexa/Google Assistant:** Interactions are linear, context-fragile, and **lose coherence after 3-5 turns**.
*   **ElliQ (Companion Robots):** Focus on companionship, limited domain scope, and high cost ($250 + $60/month subscription).
*   **AI Suites (Adobe, Perplexity):** Not designed for elderly cognition or digital literacy.

### Slide 4: The Solution – The AI Accessibility Layer

# Senior AI
**The Accessible Gateway to AI Services + Digital Life**

We are an **accessibility layer** for the entire AI ecosystem, making thousands of AI services usable through one elderly-optimized interface.

| What We Enable | Details | Domains (14+ Life Areas) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Create** | Generate images, videos, presentations, stories, poems | **Create, Media, Entertainment** |
| **📚 Learn** | Research new topics, explore culture safely | **Learn, Services** |
| **📲 Connect** | Communicate with family, share memories, collaborate | **Communication, Home** |
| **🏛 Execute** | Banking, healthcare, government, shopping, travel, legal | **Healthcare, Banking, Government, Transport, Shopping, Legal, Insurance, Energy, Tax** |

# How It Works: Cognitive-Accessible by Design
*   **Conversation Atlas:** Multi-resolution interface for **30+ turns context retention**.
*   **Safe Branching (Non-Destructive DAG):** Explore "what if" scenarios without losing the main thread.
*   **AI Apps:** Visual workflow skeletons that transform complex tasks (e.g., bank transfers) into **clear, confidence-building, step-by-step journeys**.

---

### Slide 5: The Innovation: Four Technical Breakthroughs (The Moat)

# Senior AI = First Elderly-Accessible AI Gateway
We combine cognitive-accessible design (W3C-compliant) with secure, EU-sovereign orchestration to create a **24-36 month replication moat**.

### 1. Branch-Preserving Conversation Atlas
*   **Innovation:** Synchronized Multi-resolution interface (Timeline | Key Points | Detail).
*   **Enables:** **6–10× context retention**, anchoring users without cognitive overload.

### 2. Non-Destructive Conversation Branching via DAG
*   **Innovation:** Conversation state maintained as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** with versioned memory.
*   **Enables:** Safe exploration of alternatives (e.g., pricing, dates) with **60-80% error reduction**.

### 3. Capability-Scoped Secure Execution
*   **Innovation:** Ephemeral, per-task capability tokens bound to conversational context and TaskGraph structure. Population-specific safety policies are enforced.
*   **Enables:** Safe execution in high-stakes regulated domains (banking, healthcare).

### 4. EU-Sovereign Orchestration Moat
*   **Innovation:** GDPR-first, EU data residency, BankID/eIDAS 2.0 integration. Multi-domain intent compiler transforms language into TaskGraphs.
*   **Enables:** Competitive moat against US/Asian Big Tech in regulated European markets.

Targeting 2.0–2.3 million users in beachhead segments by Year 5.

# Beachhead Strategy: Scandinavia + DACH (Years 1-2)
We target markets with mature digital identity and healthcare infrastructure:
*   **Geographies:** Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria.
*   **Rationale:** High elderly digital literacy (65-70% online) and established **BankID/ePrescription** infrastructure.
*   **Willingness to Pay:** Proven willingness to pay (€150–180 ARPU/year) validated by existing spending on telecare and tech support.

# Domain Expansion (18 Months)
*   **Phase 1 (Alpha):** Healthcare, Banking, Transport, Government (4 domains).
*   **Phase 2 (Beta):** Shopping, Food delivery, Energy, Tax (8 domains total).
*   **Phase 3 (Production):** Legal, Insurance, Entertainment, Communication, Travel, Home services (**14 domains total**).

### Slide 8: Competitive Positioning & Defensibility

# Competitive Positioning: The Uncontested Quadrant
Senior AI is the only player combining complex, multi-domain task execution with elderly-specific cognitive design.

| | **Generic Design** | **Elderly-Specific Design** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Simple Tasks** | Alexa, Google Assistant | ElliQ, Senior Tablets |
| **Complex Tasks** | ChatGPT, Claude, AI Suites | **Senior AI** ← |

# Our Defensible Moat (24–36 Months)
1.  **Proprietary IP:** Conversation Atlas + DAG Branching architecture is patent-pending, requiring 18–24 months R&D to replicate.
2.  **Regulatory Moat:** **GDPR-first** architecture, EN 301 549 (EAA) compliance, and deep integration with **BankID/eIDAS 2.0**. US/Asian competitors cannot easily match this.
3.  **Population Safety Tuning:** Elderly-tuned risk detection and safety policies enforced via capability-scoped tokens, reducing errors by 60–80%.
4.  **Network Effects:** Value increases with each integrated service (14+ domains) and generation of structured, branch-aware memory.
