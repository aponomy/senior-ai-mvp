## Executive Summary

Senior AI is an **accessibility layer for the entire AI ecosystem**, making thousands of AI services (ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL-E, Claude, etc.) accessible to Europe's elderly citizens. We address a **€6-14B market opportunity** serving 109-110M elderly (65+) across EU27+UK+NO, enabling them to:

- **Create**: Generate images, videos, presentations, written works through accessible AI tools
- **Learn**: Research topics, explore interests, discover knowledge via powerful AI assistants
- **Connect**: Communicate, collaborate, share memories with family and community
- **Execute**: Banking, healthcare, government, shopping (14+ life domains) with confidence

Our target segment—**70-85M Europeans aged 65+ who lack basic digital skills**—faces dual exclusion: essential services moving online AND the AI revolution's creative/learning opportunities remaining inaccessible. The company targets **€30-65M ARR** from 300-650k users within 5 years through a hybrid B2C subscription + B2B2C partnership model.

**Market Validation**: Strong demand validated through:
- Elderly already pay €15-40/month for inferior single-purpose tech (telecare, medical alerts)
- Municipalities spend €500-2,000/participant/year on digital inclusion (€72-108/year wholesale = 80-95% savings)
- Care providers spend €2,250/client/year on digital task assistance (€72-96/year = 95% savings)

**Business Model Viability**:
- **Unit economics**: LTV €375-562, CAC €75-200, 3:1 ratio achieved by Year 2
- **Margins**: 75-85% gross margins at scale (software-only advantage)
- **Profitability**: Break-even Year 3-4 at ~66k MAU, EBITDA positive thereafter
- **5-year revenue**: €1.1M → €4.8M → €15.6M → €37.8M → €64M (base case)

**European Added Value**:
- **Policy alignment**: EU Digital Decade 2030 (80% digital skills target), UN Decade of Healthy Ageing, EAA compliance (June 2025), AI Act readiness
- **Data sovereignty**: GDPR-first, EU-only processing, no US/Asian alternatives address European needs
- **Creative empowerment**: AI ecosystem gateway democratizes creative/learning opportunities for elderly
- **Social impact**: €970M/year economic value at 500k users (avoided LTC costs, caregiver productivity, health outcomes, creative engagement)
- **Environmental**: 1-2 kg CO₂e/user/year (15-60× lower than hardware alternatives)

**Differentiation from AI Suites**: Unlike Adobe Firefly, Perplexity, or ChatGPT Plus (powerful but not elderly-accessible), Senior AI is an **accessibility layer** making these services usable through our cognitive-accessible **Conversation Atlas** interface. We don't repackage; we make accessible.

**Risk Profile**: Medium and manageable
- 19 risks identified across market, regulatory, technical, business, and team categories
- Comprehensive mitigation strategies with €3.38M budget (covered by EIC grant)
- Top priorities: Team scaling (5-7 FTEs Year 2), market validation (10-15 B2B2C pilots Year 1), competitive moats (GDPR-first positioning, network effects by Year 3)

**Strategic Positioning**: Only European, GDPR-first, software-only, AI ecosystem gateway specifically designed for elderly with cognitive accessibility focus. 2-3 year window before Big Tech enters, requiring speed and B2B2C focus to establish defensible position.

**Target Audiences**:
- **Primary**: Elderly 65-80 with basic digital skills but struggle with complexity
- **Secondary**: Adult children (45-60) making tech decisions for parents
- **Tertiary**: Municipalities, care providers (B2B2C decision-makers)

---

### 5.5 Funding & Milestone Strategy

**EIC Grant Utilization (€2.5M)**:
- Year 1: €1.7M (team 5 FTEs, product development, compliance, pilot programs)
- Year 2: €0.8M (team growth to 10 FTEs, geographic expansion, certifications)

**EIC Equity Tranche (€2-4M, Year 2)**:
- **Trigger**: Year 1 success (≥10k MAU, ≥10 pilots, ≥80% TCR, LTV:CAC ≥2:1)
- **Use**: Sales/BD scaling, German/Dutch market entry, B2B2C partnerships
- **Dilution**: 15-30% at €10-20M valuation (acceptable given EIC strategic value)

**Self-Funding from Year 3**:
- EBITDA €7M (Year 3) → €21M (Year 4) → €43M (Year 5)
- No additional equity required if base case achieved
- Optionality for strategic acquisition or independence

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Investment Thesis

**Market Opportunity**: €6-14B TAM serving 71-92M addressable elderly with validated demand (existing €15-40/month spending, municipal €500-2,000/year programs). Target €30-65M ARR (1.2-2.6% penetration) is conservative and achievable.

**Business Model**: Strong unit economics (3:1 LTV:CAC, 75-85% margins, 10-month payback), dual revenue streams (B2C + B2B2C), clear profitability path (EBITDA positive Year 2-3), capital-efficient (software-only).

**European Value**: Unique EU positioning (GDPR-first, multilingual, eIDAS integration), policy tailwinds (Digital Decade, EAA, AI Act), massive social impact (€970M/year economic value, SDG alignment), environmental superiority (15-60× lower carbon vs hardware).

**Competitive Position**: No direct competitor addresses full need (EU privacy + elderly accessibility + multi-domain + affordable). 2-3 year window before Big Tech, mitigated by regulatory moats and B2B2C contracts.

**Risk Profile**: Medium and manageable (19 risks identified, comprehensive mitigations, €3.38M risk budget covered by EIC grant). Top priorities: team scaling, market validation, competitive moats.

**Team**: Klas (technical/Knowing Company) + Martin (business/Blodtrycksdoktorn, Yazen) = complementary skills. Scaling to 5-7 FTEs Year 2 addresses execution risk.

### 7.2 Why Senior AI Will Succeed

**1. Right Problem**: Digital exclusion of elderly = urgent, growing, underfunded. EU policy mandates (80% skills 2030, EAA 2025) create tailwinds.

**2. Right Solution**: Software-only, GDPR-first, cognitive accessibility = addresses European elderly needs unlike US/Asian alternatives.

**3. Right Business Model**: Hybrid B2C + B2B2C balances quick revenue (B2C) with scale and defensibility (B2B2C). Strong unit economics (3:1 LTV:CAC).

**4. Right Timing**: 2025-2027 window before Big Tech enters. EAA 2025 deadline, EUDI wallet rollout, aging crisis = now or never.

**5. Right Team**: Technical + business complementarity, relevant experience (Knowing Company AI, Blodtrycksdoktorn/Yazen healthcare/B2B).

**6. Right Support**: EIC Accelerator (€2.5M grant + up to €15M equity) provides runway, validation, network to execute.
