## Executive Summary

This synthesis integrates all research findings into a coherent financial plan for Senior AI's EIC Accelerator application, covering:
- €2.5M grant budget (18 months, TRL 5→8)
- €3.0M EIC equity investment (16.67% dilution)
- 5-year financial projections to break-even and profitability
- Capitalization table with ESOP and dilution scenarios

**Key Decisions Confirmed**:
- Founders: 55k SEK/month (€4,783), 75% time during grant = €65k each
- ESOP: 12% created pre-EIC (founders diluted 50% → 44% each)
- No advisor equity allocated
- Co-investors: ALMI Invest + Nordic VCs (target €1-2M alongside EIC)
- Geographic focus: Sweden/Norway/Germany (Y1-2) → UK/NL/DK (Y3-4)
- Patents deferred to post-grant phase
- Hybrid work model (flexible, cost-optimized)

- SOM (Year 5): €64M ARR = 1-2% market penetration

**Growth Assumptions**:

### Sensitivity Analysis

#### Best Case Scenario
- EIC equity: €2.5M at €18M pre (12.2% dilution)
- Series A: €15M at €60M pre (20% dilution)
- MAU growth: +25% vs base
- Combined founder ownership post-Series A: 61.8%

- MAU growth: -20% vs base
- Combined founder ownership post-Series A: 51.1%

**All scenarios maintain founder control (>50% combined) and strong motivation.**

## Part 5: Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### Financial Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|------------|
| **Revenue ramp slower than projected** | Medium | High | - Conservative MAU targets<br>- Focus on B2B2C for predictable revenue<br>- Maintain 18+ months runway |
| **CAC higher than expected** | Medium | Medium | - Prioritize partnership channels (lower CAC)<br>- Build referral programs<br>- Invest in content marketing (long-tail) |
| **Churn higher than elderly benchmark** | Low-Medium | Medium | - Habit-forming use cases (BankID)<br>- Family involvement features<br>- Proactive support and onboarding |
| **Infrastructure costs scale poorly** | Low | Medium | - Multi-cloud strategy<br>- LLM cost optimization (model mix)<br>- Monitor unit economics monthly |
| **Pilot-to-contract conversion fails** | Medium | High | - Legal/procurement support budget<br>- Direct-award threshold strategies<br>- Proof of ROI from pilots |
| **Series A timing delays** | Medium | High | - Break-even by Year 3 (self-funded)<br>- €16M cash post-Year 2 = 39 months runway<br>- Bridge financing options |
| **Co-investor commitment fails** | Low-Medium | Medium | - ALMI discussions advanced<br>- Multiple VC conversations<br>- EIC can proceed without co-investors |

### Mitigation Strategies

**Revenue Risk**:
- 10-15 B2B2C pilots in Year 1 (diversified)
- Conservative penetration assumptions (1-2% of SAM)
- Multiple revenue streams (B2C, municipalities, care, insurers, telcos)

**Cost Control**:
- Hybrid work model (reduced office costs)
- Strategic hiring (ramp to 22 FTEs by end Y1, not 30+)
- LLM optimization (80% GPT-4o-mini, 20% Claude)
- Infrastructure monitoring and auto-scaling

**Cash Management**:
- Maintain 18-24 months runway at all times
- Break-even by Year 3 (operating cash flow positive)
- Post-Series A: 39 months runway = no Series B pressure
